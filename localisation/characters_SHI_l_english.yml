  SHI_AKIGAHAI_NAME: "Akigahai"
  SHI_AKIGAHAI_DESC: "They say that sometimes all you will learn in defeat is that you have been defeated. But Akigahai learned more - that the Dragon and Lo Pan were trapped in a stagnant cycle. No, the strongest could only emerge in a land where all could strive and compete unbound by tradition and ancient mantras. A land where the strong could rise to power over their lessers, where rank and favour did not come from birth or gender. Akigahai found this promise in the NCR, the land where a peasant girl could become their queen, and a tribal their saviour. Now with the followers she found in the Hub, the Boneyard, and Shady Sands, she will lift the logs from the eyes of the Shi - and build a society where all can take what they want, and do what they want."

  SHI_LO_PAN_NAME: "Lo Pan"
  SHI_LO_PAN_DESC: "§R"Through strength, I gain power.\nThrough power, I gain victory.\nThrough victory, my chains are broken."§!\n\nLo Pan ruled the Shi since 2241, when the Chosen One aided him against the Dragon. Some would call him a ruthless bully, but nothing could be further from the truth. Lo Pan believes that the strong should rule, and he is nothing but the strongest. But so what? The strong always ruled, whether in the time of the Ming or Mao Dynasties or before he took over. The Dragon kept everyone in their places and discouraged outsiders from visiting the Shi. He would keep the city in a bubble. But it was Lo Pan who worked with the Chosen One to prevail, and it is Lo Pan who welcomed the NCR's merchants and scholars. The elders, over their tea, complain, but so what? Change and competition are the way of the world; if one does not bend, one will break."

  SHI_DRAGON_NAME: "The Dragon"
  SHI_DRAGON_DESC: "Those who fight without honour are no better than animals!\n\nAnd what does that make the NCR, who sends mercenaries to subvert the Dragon's teachings? Who lure people away from the Emperor with the Followers' free schooling? How can you say you fight oppression when your ranchers oppress the Shi of Northern California? The Dragon will lead the Shi to glory, and cleanse California of the cancer."

  SHI_ELDER_FRANCIS_NAME: "Elder Francis"

Now he leads the Shi into a brighter future, as part of the chain that will unite the Wasteland - and strangle the Bear."

  SHI_NORTON_NAME: "King Norton II"
  SHI_NORTON_DESC: "Although Norton rules over a land which is not his own, he wishes for its prosperity nonetheless. Teleported here by cosmic forces unknown to him, for purposes even more unknown, he faces everyday as if this was always the life he lived. Because if he doesn't succeed than the entire wasteland will have no hope left and that cannot be allowed to happen. Though this is not the America he knows, it's still the America he is in and it is his duty to his people to fight against the decay of the world."
  
  SHI_CHANG_HO_NAME: "Chang Ho"
  SHI_CHANG_HO_DESC: "§4"Only strength and the lessons provided can bring the world to a better path."§!\n\nOnce a fisherman, Chang Ho underwent Ghoulification over thirty years ago, when he thought sailing to where the Oil Rig sank would result in riches beyond compare. As he tells it, the true riches were within- his trials returning home revealed just how you need to make the hard choices to survive, Tying your life to outsiders is risking being thrown overboard in a storm. Akigahai understands these choices, not Lo Pan."
  
  SHI_XU_LUQI_NAME: "Xu Luqi"
  SHI_XU_LUQI_DESC: "§4"Everything working properly together can bring the world to a better path."§! \n\nA graduate of the Followers' University in the Boneyard, Luqi returned to San Francisco intending to hire on with a local caravan business. Her attempts to get back in shape ended with a few surprising victories against the Crane school. As it turns out, her personal studies in close-range combat combined with her formal studies in logistics were a brilliant combination that Lo Pan could not ignore. Not that she cares about the struggle- Luqi just wants the Shi to succeed."
  
  SHI_KNIGHT_GOU_NAME: "Knight Gou"
  SHI_KNIGHT_GOU_DESC: "§4"With your help, we can bring the world to a better path."§! \n\nGou Da has faithfully served the Emperor and Francis simultaneously for many years. When not training the defenders of the Shi in doctrines long lost, this Knight puts together teams to assist in the recovery of technology from the dangers of the Wasteland. The welding of Shi and Brotherhood of Steel ideology is so strong, one wonders what can break it at long last- and what his true mission is."
