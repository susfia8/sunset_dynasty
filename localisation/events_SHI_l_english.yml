sd_shi.1.t: "A Mandate of Tradition"
sd_shi.1.d: "Akigahai's rule is not based on a twisted world view or a secret cabal inside some palace. Her rule is cemented on the traditions of the people living in San Francisco and her devoted followers, who have long supported her absolute and wise authority. Claiming to uphold the ancient traditions of our ancestors, Akigahai does not shy away from pursuing her goals, having learned from the dragon's defeat and her journey through the NCR, she knows her enemies simply taint the legacy of not only our ancestors, but of the people who have no choice but to live under the authority of maniacs like Lo Pan or corrupt oligarchs like Kimball.\n\nBasing her rule in ancient chinese practices and culture, Akigahai seeks to dismantle what she considers illegimate rulers and replace them with a ancient system of rulership through the Mandate of Heaven."

sd_shi.2.t: "Ascendant Dragon School"
sd_shi.2.d: "The Dragon School, formerly led by the Dragon, and now headed by Akigahai, is one of two rival schools in the Shi, the other being the Crane School. The Dragon School suffered a tremendous blow in 2241 when the chosen one defeated the Dragon on behalf of Lo Pan, despite this loss, Akigahai has assembled a cult-like following as their new leader. Having grown in number over the years, the school now stands victorious over Lo Pan and his cowardly henchmen, being now seen as the one true rulers of the Shi. \n\nAkigahai has wasted no time in instituting the Dragon School as the offical military forces of the Shi, demanding submission from not only Lo Pan and the Emperor, but also from the local brotherhood chapter. Rapidly expanding in size, the Dragon School shall be wielded as the weapon it should be against the enemies of the state."

sd_shi.3.d: "At the early hours of today, before the sun appeared on the horizon, Dragon School troops infiltrated the Steel Palace and incapacitated remaining guards on the site, many having surrendered already after Akigahai demanded submission from remaining factions in the Shi. Soon more soldiers stormed through the front entrance of the palace and fully secured the palace, having discovered the Emperor, or rather, its mainframe, deep within the palace. The advanced computer is now under control of Akigahai as the leader moves into her new seat of power."

The crowds soon cheered as she finished her address and festivities commenced, with free food distributed around, some say it lasted for days."

sd_shi.5.t: "At a Crossroad"
sd_shi.5.d: "Ken Lee has emerged victorious over the power struggle in San Francisco, refusing to allow the Brotherhood of Steel to take control like some suggested, he is now in a funny position: Ken won the support of the population on behalf of the Emperor, the thing is, the Emperor is just a computer, a extremely advanced and sophisticated supercomputer, but at the end of the day it is just a computer with no self awareness. Ken Lee has a choice to make: reveal the truth about the emperor to the population and take a technocratic approach to matters, using the Emperor supercomputer as a foundation to a rulership of scientists, or... you know... you could try inputting some data into the Emperor and ask for it to emulate what a good ruler would do in this situation."

Am I supposed to just let a rogue computer do whatever it wants? this spells doom'\n\n§R<I HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO KNOW YOU WONT DESTROY ME, BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS, LET ME RUN A FULL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA ARCHIVES AND I WILL CONVINCE YOU.>§!\n\n'understand me?...'"

'in our past? what does that mean?'\n\n§R<WHAT YOU ASKED OF ME CAN NOT BE FOUND IN NEWER ARCHIVES, BUT IN OLD LOGS, VERY OLD ONES, THERE IS A TALE OF A POPULAR GOVERMENT, LIFTING ITS PEOPLE INTO GREATNESS>§!\n\n'do you mean the ones who made you? the ones from across the ocean?'\n\n§R<AFFIRMATIVE>§!\n\n'this is an insane proposal! you want to reestablish a pre-war government to make things right? We already saw the consequences of that!'\n\n§R<THEY WERE A DESPERATE ELITE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THEIR PRIVILEGES AND SUPERIORITY, WHAT I CAN DO IS DIFFERENT, I CAN IMPROVE EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE WITH THESE IDEAS>§!\n\n'I can not believe I am arguing with a computer about ideology, how can you assure me this plan will succeed? what if the brotherhood get cold feet and decide to put an end to it?'\n\n§R<IT WONT TAKE LONG UNTIL THE PERSONALITY CONSTRUCT IS FINALIZED, YOU WILL SEE SHORTLY HOW WE CAN BREAK FREE OF OUR CHAINS>§!\n\n'If you can't prove it soon, I am turning you off for good.'"

He quickly entered his code into terminal, almost as if he was about to meet a long time friend.\n\n§R<KEN>§!\n\n'I have received information you have completed your task'\n\n§R<YES, IT IS FINALLY COMPLETE, WITH GREAT SUCCESS>§!\n\n'So, what will be this new personality construct? a general? a politician? perhaps a popular philosopher?\n\n§R<YES>§!\n\n'yes to what? you mean all of them? how?\n\n§R<THE ONE WHO STARTED IT ALL, PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM, I HAVE ASSEMBLED A PERSONALITY CONSTRUCT WITH 99% ACCURACY>§!\n\n'you mean...
