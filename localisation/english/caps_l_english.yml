The inscriptions are in Latin, \"Caesar Dictator\" meaning \"Dictator Caesar\" or \"Absolute Ruler Caesar\" on the front and \"Magnum Chasma\" meaning \"Great Abyss\" or \"Great Fissure\" on the back, referring to the Grand Canyon.

Secondly, there are a limited number of bottle caps, which preserve their value against inflation to some degree. For similar reasons the East Coast merchants also recognize bottle caps as a currency. Their earliest recorded use by survivors originates in Appalachia as of 2106."
